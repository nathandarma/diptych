# Product Requirements Document: Interactive Diptych & Triptych Creator
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the product requirements for an interactive web application, "CollageCraft" (working title), designed to enable users to easily create and customize diptych and triptych image collages. The application will be built using React and leverage the HeroUI component library (or a similar Tailwind CSS-based library) for a modern and responsive user interface.

1.2 Goals

To provide an intuitive and user-friendly platform for creating multi-image collages (diptychs and triptychs).

To offer users flexibility in choosing layout structures, aspect ratios, and aesthetic customizations (background color, border thickness).

To allow precise control over image placement, including panning and scaling within individual frames.

To enable users to export their creations in high resolution for various uses.

To deliver a responsive experience across desktop and mobile devices.

1.3 Target Audience

Social media users and content creators looking to enhance their visual posts.

Photographers wanting to showcase multiple images in a single, cohesive piece.

Bloggers and website owners needing custom image collages for their content.

Casual users seeking a simple tool for creative image arrangements.

2. Product Overview
CollageCraft will be a client-side web application where users can select a collage type (diptych or triptych), choose an overall aspect ratio, upload images into distinct frames, adjust these images, customize the collage's appearance, and finally export the finished product.

2.1 User Stories

As a social media manager, I want to quickly create a 9:16 triptych for an Instagram Story, so that I can showcase three related product images effectively.

As a photographer, I want to create a 3:4 diptych with a thin border and a specific background color, so that I can present two complementary photos from a recent shoot.

As a blogger, I want to easily upload images into a 16:9 triptych, adjust their position and scale within each frame, so that I can create a custom header image for my latest post.

As a casual user, I want to select a 1:1 diptych, upload photos of my pets, and export it, so that I can share a fun image on my social profiles.

As any user, I want to be able to adjust the thickness of the border between images and change the background color, so that the collage matches my desired aesthetic.

As any user, I want to export my created collage in a high-resolution format, so that it looks sharp when printed or viewed online.

2.2 Key Features

Layout Selection: Choose between diptych (2 frames) and triptych (3 frames) layouts.

Diptych: Side-by-side (horizontal), Stacked (vertical).

Triptych: Three horizontal, three vertical, 2+1 arrangements (e.g., one large, two small).

Aspect Ratio Control: Select from common aspect ratios for the overall collage (1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 9:16, 16:9).

Image Upload: Click on individual frames to upload images from the user's local device.

Image Manipulation:

Pan (move) image within its frame.

Scale (zoom in/out) image within its frame.

Customization:

Adjustable background color for the collage.

Adjustable border thickness (and potentially color) between frames and around the collage.

Real-time Preview: Users see their changes reflected live on the canvas.

Export: Download the final collage as a high-resolution image file (e.g., PNG or JPEG).

Responsive Design: The application interface and functionality should adapt to different screen sizes.

3. Detailed Features
3.1 Workspace & Canvas

Main Canvas: A central area displaying the selected collage layout. This is where users interact with frames and see a live preview.

Control Panel: A sidebar or top bar containing all controls for layout, aspect ratio, customization, and export.

3.2 Layout Selection

Diptych Options:

Visual representation for 2 images side-by-side (horizontal split).

Visual representation for 2 images stacked (vertical split).

Triptych Options:

Visual representation for 3 images side-by-side (horizontal split).

Visual representation for 3 images stacked (vertical split).

Visual representation for 1 large frame and 2 smaller frames (e.g., left large, two stacked right).

Visual representation for 2 smaller frames and 1 large frame (e.g., two stacked left, right large).

The selected layout will dynamically update the main canvas.

3.3 Aspect Ratio Selection

A dropdown or button group allowing users to select: 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 9:16, 16:9.

The main canvas and its frames will resize according to the chosen aspect ratio while maintaining the internal layout structure.

3.4 Image Upload and Manipulation

Frame Interaction:

Each frame in the collage layout will be a distinct interactive area.

Clicking an empty frame (or a frame with a placeholder icon) will trigger a file input dialog for image selection.

Supported image formats: JPEG, PNG, WEBP.

Image Display:

Once an image is uploaded, it will be displayed within the boundaries of its designated frame.

Default positioning: centered and scaled to fit or fill (user preference or smart default).

Image Panning:

Users can click and drag an image within its frame to change its visible portion.

Panning should be constrained to the image's boundaries (i.e., cannot pan to show empty space if the image is smaller than the frame at current scale).

Image Scaling:

A slider, +/- buttons, or mouse wheel scroll associated with the selected frame/image to control its scale (zoom).

Scaling should occur from the center of the image or a user-defined point.

Minimum scale should prevent the image from becoming smaller than the frame if "fill" is desired.

3.5 Customization

Background Color:

A color picker tool (e.g., using <input type="color"> or a HeroUI equivalent) to select the background color of the collage. This color fills any space not occupied by images or borders.

Option for a transparent background if exporting as PNG.

Border Thickness:

A slider or input field to adjust the thickness of the borders/gutters between frames and potentially around the entire collage.

Units: pixels. Range: e.g., 0px to 50px.

(Optional) Border Color:

A color picker for the border color, defaulting to a neutral color or matching the background.

3.6 Export Functionality

Export Button: A clear "Export" or "Download" button.

Resolution: The exported image should be high-resolution, ideally based on the natural dimensions of the uploaded images or a user-selectable output size/DPI. For web use, a resolution that matches the on-screen preview at a good quality (e.g., 2x the display dimensions) should be sufficient. For "high-res," consider allowing export up to a certain pixel limit (e.g., 4000x4000px) or based on the source images.

File Format:

Default: PNG (to support transparency if background is transparent).

Option: JPEG (for smaller file sizes, with quality setting).

Process: Client-side generation of the image using HTML Canvas API. The final arrangement, including images, their positions/scales, background, and borders, will be drawn onto a canvas element, which is then converted to an image data URL for download.

4. Design and UX Considerations
4.1 User Interface (UI)

Clean and Modern: Utilize HeroUI components (Tailwind CSS) for a visually appealing and contemporary design.

Intuitive Controls: All options should be clearly labeled and easy to understand. Visual icons should supplement text labels where appropriate.

Responsive Layout: The entire application interface must be responsive and usable on various screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.

Interactive Feedback: Provide clear visual feedback for user actions (e.g., button clicks, active selection, loading states).

4.2 User Experience (UX) Flow

Landing/Main Page: User sees a default collage canvas (e.g., diptych, 1:1) and the control panel.

Layout & Ratio Selection: User selects the desired number of frames (diptych/triptych) and the overall aspect ratio. The canvas updates.

Image Upload: User clicks on an empty frame. A file dialog opens. User selects an image. Image appears in the frame.

Image Adjustment: User clicks on a frame containing an image to select it. Controls for pan and scale become active for that image. User adjusts as needed.

Customization: User adjusts background color and border thickness using controls. Changes are reflected live.

Repeat 3-5: User populates other frames and makes adjustments.

Export: User clicks "Export." Chooses format/settings if applicable. Image is generated and downloaded.

4.3 Accessibility

Ensure keyboard navigability.

Provide ARIA attributes for interactive elements.

Ensure sufficient color contrast.

5. Technical Considerations
5.1 Frontend

Framework: React.js

Component Library: HeroUI (or a similar Tailwind CSS-based library like DaisyUI, Headless UI with custom Tailwind styling).

State Management: React Context API or a lightweight state management library (e.g., Zustand, Jotai) if complexity grows.

Image Handling:

HTML5 File API for image uploads.

HTML Canvas API for rendering the final collage, including image transformations (pan, scale), background, and borders. This canvas will be used for the export functionality.

Styling: Tailwind CSS.

5.2 Image Processing

All image processing (loading, panning, scaling, rendering to canvas) should ideally happen client-side to reduce server load and improve responsiveness.

Consider performance implications for very large images. May need to use downscaled versions for preview and full-resolution for export, or implement smart rendering.

5.3 High-Resolution Export

The export functionality will involve creating an off-screen canvas at the desired output resolution.

Draw all elements (images at their correct transformations, background, borders) onto this high-resolution canvas.

Convert the canvas content to a data URL (canvas.toDataURL()) or blob (canvas.toBlob()) for download.

6. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)
More Layouts: Introduce more complex triptych layouts or even quadtych+ options.

Text Overlay: Allow users to add text to their collages.

Image Filters/Effects: Basic image adjustments (brightness, contrast, grayscale) per frame.

Predefined Templates: Offer a gallery of pre-designed templates with specific layouts and styles.

Saving Projects: Allow users to save their work in progress (requires backend or local storage).

Social Sharing: Direct sharing options to popular social media platforms.

Image Source Integrations: Allow image import from cloud services (Google Photos, Dropbox) or stock photo sites (Unsplash).

7. Success Metrics
Number of unique visitors and active users.

Number of collages created and exported.

Average time spent on the application.

User feedback and ratings.

Adoption rate of different features (which layouts, aspect ratios are most popular).
